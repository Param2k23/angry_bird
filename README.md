## Introduction

The Flappy Bird Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a bird and tries to navigate it through a series of pipes without colliding with them. This implementation is developed using Python and the Pygame library, providing a fun and interactive gaming experience.

## Features

- **Flap Control:** The player controls the bird's altitude by pressing a designated key to make it flap and avoid obstacles.
  
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The game features pipes that the bird must navigate through by flying in the gaps between them.

- **Game Over:** The game ends if the bird collides with the pipes or the screen's edges. The player can restart the game after a collision.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The primary programming language for developing the game.
- Pygame: A cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games.
- Object-Oriented Design: Using classes and objects to represent game elements.
- Event Handling: Responding to player input and updating game state accordingly.

## Setup

1. **Install Pygame:** If you haven't already, install the Pygame library using pip:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flappy-bird-game.git
   ```

3. **Run the Game:** Navigate to the project directory and run the game script:
   ```
   python flappy_bird.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Game Start:** Press the designated key to make the bird flap and start the game.

2. **Gameplay:** Keep the bird afloat by tapping the flap key. Navigate through the gaps in the pipes to score points.

3. **Game Over:** The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or the screen's edges. The final score is displayed.

4. **Restart:** After a collision, press the designated key to restart the game and try to beat your previous score.
